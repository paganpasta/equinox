# Stateful operations

These are the tools that underly stateful operations, like [`equinox.nn.BatchNorm`][] or [`equinox.nn.SpectralNorm`][].

See the [stateful example](../../examples/stateful.ipynb) for an example of working with stateful operations.

::: equinox.nn.State
    selection:
        members:
            - __init__

::: equinox.nn.StateIndex
    selection:
        members:
            - __init__

::: equinox.nn.StatefulLayer
    selection:
        members:
            - __call__
